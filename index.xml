      <description>I am a software engineering student (final year), working with Java mainly and playing with Go. I love backend, writing SAAS, using cloud technologies and discrete math. The topics in software engineering I am the most passionate about is Software Architecture and Software design (i.e. beautiful code). I am currently taking graduate classes at Concordia University in Artifical Inteligence because this domain bridge the gap between great fields in mathematics and programing.</description>
