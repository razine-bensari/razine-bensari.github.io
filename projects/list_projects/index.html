    <p>I have worked on a few interesting projects but have not had the time
to put them here. You can check out my github and send me a message on LinkedIn if you are interested.</p>
<p>So far, I have worked on:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobile Development in React Native:</strong> Google map mobile app focused on Concordia University&rsquo;s campus and indoor directions for students, faculty and staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Basic of machine learning (in pure python):</strong> Implemented a Naive Bayes Classifier to distinguish tweets languages (6 classes). Trained the models, tested them and did some &ldquo;hyper-parameter tuning&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>State Space Search (in pure python):</strong> Implemented Depth First Search (DFS), Best First Search (BF) and Algorithm A* for the a known as &ldquo;Lights out&rdquo;.
Achieved small computation time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HTTP Protocol and Reliable Data transfer (Data Communication and Networks):</strong> This project was written in JAVA using barebone socket interfaces. In a team of two, we implemented partially a replica of the curl command line
(only get and post requests), with support for concurrent requests. We also implemented an HTTP file server with support for concurrent requests. On top of that
we implemented a Reliable Data Transfer (RDT) using selective repeat protocol. We managed to achieve it successfully for the GET requests from client side.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am looking to work with GO, work on machine learning projects, work on SAAS solutions or anything in between that can allow me to learn more and solve challenging problems.</p>
<p>More projects incoming soon.</p>
<p>Hit me up!</p>
